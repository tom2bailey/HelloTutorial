# HelloTutorial
IntroTutorial

This is line 3 of the ReadMe.md entry.  I wonder why the suffix is .md?  
More learning to go!

This is a little bit about me.  I want to use Git and Git hub for some Rstudio work to share with my brother.

And maybe others will benfit as well.

And some more changes, so I can follow directions and enter a commit comment.
