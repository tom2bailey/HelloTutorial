Adding a new line near the top, in the middle of a prior edit.  Just to see what this looks like (to add another commit comment)

This is line 3 of the ReadMe.md entry.  I wonder why the suffix is .md?  (this is an addition to an existing line)
Deleting and changing a prior line, not just adding a line

This is a little bit about me.  
<,deleted part of the old line 8>
This is a new line at line 10 And some other stuff.
<an even newer line 10, and maybe more ....

and more 
...
and more

<old line 10> And maybe others will benfit as well.

And some more changes, so I can follow directions and enter a commit comment. (to add another commit comment)
